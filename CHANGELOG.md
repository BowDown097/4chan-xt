## 4chan XT changelog

4chan XT uses a different user script namespace than 4chan X, so to migrate you need to export settings from 4chan X,
and import them in XT.

  [#71 \(comment)](https://github.com/TuxedoTako/4chan-xt/issues/71#issuecomment-2241358550)

### 2.11.0 (2024-07-20)

- Automatic conversion of invalid image files in the quick reply.
  - When encountering an invalid image format, like webp, it will convert to png, depending on browser support.
  - When the resolution of an image is too large, it will be shrunk.
  - When an image file is too big, it will be converted to jpg with increasingly lower quality until it fits.
    [#72](https://github.com/TuxedoTako/4chan-xt/issues/72)
    - There is a button to convert to jpg manually in the quick reply.
  - A warning will be shown is an image was changed automatically.
  - There is a new preview button on the quick reply modal to check the result before posting.
  - This uses build-in functionality of the browser, so only image formats that the browser supports can be converted,
    and no videos can be converted.
- File thumbnails are now always opened when a file is added in the quick reply.
  [#75](https://github.com/TuxedoTako/4chan-xt/issues/75)
- Post filtering and highlighting aren't mutually exclusive anymore. Stubs are affected by the highlight class.

### 2.10.2 (2024-06-15)

- Fixed wrong link on dead links to other threads. [#70](https://github.com/TuxedoTako/4chan-xt/issues/70)
- Fixed quoted OPs not showing reply and image count. [#71](https://github.com/TuxedoTako/4chan-xt/issues/71) Might be a
  new feature, since it seems it was never supported, but I'm counting it as a bug fix because native 4chan has it.

### 2.10.1 (2024-06-01)

- Address wobbly spin animation. [#65](https://github.com/TuxedoTako/4chan-xt/pull/65)
- Remove dead link to Mayhem archive documentation. [#66](https://github.com/TuxedoTako/4chan-xt/pull/66)

    or nothing.
- Remember QR size option is no longer Firefox only. [#61](https://github.com/TuxedoTako/4chan-xt/pull/61)
- CSS custom properties, also known as CSS variables, used by 4chan XT are now documented in
  [src/css/README.md](./src/css/README.md).
- Now that 4chan redirects to https, http support is dropped.
  [#61 \(comment\)](https://github.com/TuxedoTako/4chan-xt/pull/61#issuecomment-2119154714)
- Also dropped 4channel.org in the list of supported sites.

### 2.9.0 (2024-05-12)

  failed. [#8 \(comment\)](https://github.com/TuxedoTako/4chan-xt/issues/8#issuecomment-2105740679)
- Button to watch threads now uses an svg icon instead of a background image, and is now a button instead of an anchor.
  This should only be important if you use custom css to style it.

### 2.8.2 (2024-05-03)

- PostHiding now waits for the board config, so the option to hide by poster ID should always appear on boards with
  those. [#41 (comment)](https://github.com/TuxedoTako/4chan-xt/issues/41#issuecomment-2087805190)
- Restoring deleted posts from archives when reply threading is active no longer recalculates the threads. Turning reply
  threading off and on again still works. [#55](https://github.com/TuxedoTako/4chan-xt/issues/55)

### 2.8.1 (2024-04-23)

- Fixed quick reply modal putting icon buttons in the wrong place in the catalog.
  [#54](https://github.com/TuxedoTako/4chan-xt/issues/54)
- Removed 'Work around CORB Bug', which was fixed in chrome 85, while this script is 90 and up.
  - Because this meant a file had a dependency less, which in combination with the circular dependencies, caused some
    files to be in a different order in the output, and caused some common variables to not have `$1` appended. So sorry
    for the giant diff.
- Code specific for the userscript isn't in the chrome extension anymore and vice versa.

### 2.8.0 (2024-04-18)

- To address the restore from archive issues [#51](https://github.com/TuxedoTako/4chan-xt/issues/51):
  - Added an error message when fetching fails instead of failing silently.
  - Added option to select archive to fetch from.
- Counting poster IDs is now used as a fallback for the missing IP count.
  [#52](https://github.com/TuxedoTako/4chan-xt/issues/52)

  failing silently. [#53](https://github.com/TuxedoTako/4chan-xt/issues/53)

### 2.7.1 (2024-04-12)

- Right-align shortcut icons in header when header links are centered.
  [#45](https://github.com/TuxedoTako/4chan-xt/pull/45)
- OneeChan compatibility fixes:
  - Do not apply highlights of your posts and replies when OneeChan is detected since the CSS specificity from XT was
    higher. [#43](https://github.com/TuxedoTako/4chan-xt/issues/43)
  - Switched from `overflow: clip;` to `overflow: auto;` on posts.
    [#44](https://github.com/TuxedoTako/4chan-xt/issues/44)

### 2.7.0 (2024-04-06)

  font. [#38](https://github.com/TuxedoTako/4chan-xt/issues/38)

  - Moved the icon buttons and submit to a new row to give the file input some space.
- Added option to hide posts by poster ID. [#41](https://github.com/TuxedoTako/4chan-xt/issues/41)
- Made the audio the source of truth for video sound posts. Should fix
  [#36](https://github.com/TuxedoTako/4chan-xt/issues/36), but I didn't find a video to longer audio to test on.

- Fixed posts scrolling under the header when navigated to by the id.
  [#10](https://github.com/TuxedoTako/4chan-xt/issues/10)
  - Now `scroll-margin-top` is used, which needed `overflow: clip;` instead of `:hidden`, which is why the minimum

- Enabled automatic updates. If you don't want updates, turn them off in your user script manager.

- Also minify css in the minified build.

### XT v2.1.4 (2023-09-02)

- Settings no longer close when the mouse ends up outside of the modal when selecting text in an input or textarea.

### XT v2.1.2 (2023-07-22)

- Fix inlining/previewing of archive links like quote links. [#5](https://github.com/TuxedoTako/4chan-xt/issues/5)

### XT v2.1.1 (2023-07-16)

- Update notification link now links to the changelog on the right branch on github.

### XT v2.1.0 (2023-06-24)

- Limited support for audio posts: they work in threads but not yet in the gallery. Might add if there's demand.
  - Can be disabled in the settings
- Small performance improvements
  - Removed unnecessary `Array.from`s from coffeescript to js migration
  - Time module: cache Intl.DateTimeFormat objects
  - callbackNodesDB: increase nr of callbacks because the setTimeout triggers a reflow, which in some of my tests took
    as long as the actual chunk of callbacks

### XT v2.0.0 (2023-04-30)

This is the first XT release, which means this is after the migration from coffeescript to typescript, but there are
some other changes as well. These changes aren't in the upstream PR.

- Optimized image filters: filters are in a Map with the hash as key, instead of iterating over all image filters
- I removed font awesome to make the script smaller, and used unicode icons instead. This might break some user scripts
  build in 4chan X that rely on them, and I only tested on windows.
- For even smaller user script size, there is a minified version available
- https://github.com/ccd0/4chan-x/pull/3352, fix for https://github.com/ccd0/4chan-x/issues/3349 was ported
